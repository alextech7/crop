		db => {
			main => {
				name => 'cz',
				server => {
					host => 'localhost',
					port => 5432,
				},
				driver => 'Pg',
				role   => {

	$server->rights->ok(%priv);
}

=begin nd
Method: S ()
	Accessor to the <Crop::Server>.

Returns:
	Server object - if is running
	'Crop' string - otherwise

TODO:
	The D() method.
