# CROP

## NAME
Creazilla on Perl – a Perl framework

## Description

Creazilla on Perl (cd abbreviated as Crop) is a Perl framework with the main goal to make writing web scripts much easy. No wide experience is required to programming a top-level script. The SQL-layer is hidden from a programmer.

Crop implements:
1. class attributes inheritance
2. automatic object synchronization with warehouse
3. http request routing, parameter parsing
4. multiple warehouses of different type at the same time
5. role-based access system

The Crop has lightweight, simple and clear architecture, that makes changes to Crop itself simple. Crop uses common Perl syntax. Getters/setters are the only code Crop generates implicitly, so debugging is easy.
